### IMPORTANT! In order to use the code you'll need the CS50 library. Follow the instructions and download the CS50 library at the link below:

https://github.com/cs50/libcs50

Once the code is downloaded there are two scripts available.

### mostvotes.c

This script is a simple vote counter. To run, the user types the name of the program and the names of the candidates. For instance, if there are three candidates (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) the user will enter:

`./plurality Alice Bob Charlie`

Once entered, the user will be prompted for the number of votes. For instance, 5. One entered, each vote will need to be entered. Once the total votes are entered, the winner is calculated.

### runoff.c

This script calculates a winner based of a runoff election. To run, the user types the name of the program and the names of the candidates. For instance, if there are three candidates (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) the user will enter:

`./plurality Alice Bob Charlie`

Once entered, the user will be prompted for the number of votes. For instance, 5. One entered, each voter will enter their choices in a ranking order. After all the voters choices are entered, the winner is calculated.
